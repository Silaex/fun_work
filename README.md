## Warning
Yes the code can be a lot easier to read and more efficient. But its one of the goal of my project to code lot of useless things that can make the code unreadable for someone else than me.
But if you find it nice, I appreciate it

# fun_work
Having fun 

## Goal of this project????
Its in the name

## Why not doing a USEFUL PROJECT WTF MAN???
I code for myself and the other myself. 

## If you're someone interested in what i do

### Post-Scriptum
Programming is to enjoy and building things you want.
Not doing things that MUST be useful and bringing money... 

If you're a company: I would be happy to help if the project that you want me to work on is as interesting and challenging as my english
